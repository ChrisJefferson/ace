Below we list the changes made to this src directory from that
supplied by Colin Ramsay and George Havas.

  Makefile.in  . . . . New file. Essentially constructed from the
                       three makefiles: make.darter, make.flute
                       and make.ozone (respectively makefiles for
                       Linux, Solaris, IRIX 6.5 - SGI Origin 2000).
                       From this file, Makefile is generated by
                       running make in the directory above.

  coinc.c  . . . . . . The unused variable l was removed on line 478.

  postproc.c . . . . . Function al2_normcl was modified. The word 
                       `normalise' was used wrongly. The comments
                       were modified and the printed output adjusted.

                     - The words `the non-normalising conjugates' 
                       previously on lines 297-298 were changed to
                       `conjugates of subgroup generators by group 
                       generators that cannot be traced to the subgroup'.
                     - The words `g/G normalise w' previously on 
                       line 303 were replaced with `gwG and Gwg are in 
                       the subgroup'. 
                     - The word `non-normalising' previously on line 309 
                       was replaced with `added'.
                     - The words `non-normalising combo.' previously on
                       line 345 were replaced with `conjugate that's not in
                       the subgrp.'
                     - The words `one non-normalised' previously on
                       line 347 were replaced with `1 conjugate not in sgp'. 
                     - In the fprintf statements previously on lines 
                       352 and 359, the words `Grp gen'r' were replaced
                       by `Conjugate by grp gen'r' and `does not normalise'
                       was replaced by `of'. (Slightly cumbersome but
                       this way the variables keep the order they had
                       before.)
                     - The words `not in subgrp' were added before \n in the 
                       fprintf statement previously on line 370.

  util1.c  . . . . . . A bug in ACE (reported with fix by Volker Gebhardt)
                       caused by a variable not being initialised was removed.
                       The line 704
    scol = 0;
                       was added and on line 714 ` && scol' was
                       inserted so that it now reads:
        else if (i == slow && scol)	/* Same row; earlier column? */
