In this appendix we give some examples of \ace\ runs.
A stand-alone discussion of some of the features of these runs is included,
  although parts of these runs are mentioned in the body of the text, as 
  illustrations of specific features of \ace's behaviour.
The \ttt{ex---.in} files supplied as part of this documentation can be
  used to run these examples, although an example may be presented as if it
  were generated interactively, and the output may be edited for reasons of
  space or perspicuity.
There may be minor variations in the exact format of the output, since
  \ace\ is continually being `improved'\kern-1pt.
Unless otherwise noted, all parameters are defaulted and the default
  build of \ace\ was used.
In multipart runs, note that parameters from an earlier part may carry
  across to a later one.
Note that some of the examples may require a machine with a large amount
  of memory.
