	                 The ACE share package

The ACE share package permits to call the Adaptive Coset Enumerator written
by George Havas and Colin Ramsay from within GAP. 

ACE coset enumerator (C) 1995-1998 by George Havas and Colin Ramsay

The GAP interface has been written by Alexander Hulpke.

The package interfaces to an external binary and therefore is only usable
under UNIX. It will not work on Windows or the Macintosh. It requires
GAP 4 in at least beta version 5.


		Installing the ACE share package

To install unpack the archive file in a directory in the `pkg' hierarchy of
your version of {\GAP}4. (This might be the `pkg' directory of the
GAP4 home directory; it is however also possible to keep an additional `pkg'
directory in you private directories, see section "ref:Installing Share
Packages" of the {\GAP}4 reference manual for details on how to do this.)
Go to the newly created `ACE' directory and call `configure <path>' where
<path> is the path to the GAP home directory. So for example if you install
the package in the main `pkg' directory call

  configure ../..

This will fetch the architecture type for which GAP has been compiled last
and create a `Makefile'. 
Now simply call

  make

to compile the binary and to install it in the appropriate place.

If you use this installation of GAP on different hardware platforms you will
have to compile the binary for each platform separately. This is done by
calling `configure' and `make' for the package anew immediately after
compiling GAP itself for the respective architecture.
If your version of GAP is already compiled (and has last been compiled on
the same architecture) you do not need to compile GAP
again, it is sufficient to call the `configure' script in the GAP home
directory.

For details on how to use the `ACE' package see the documentation in the
`doc' subdirectory.

The `src' subdirectory contains a copy of the original source of `ACE'. (The
only modification is that a make-file was copied to `Makefile'.) You can
replace it by a newer version before compiling.

If you encounter problems, please write to `ahulpke@dcs.st-and.ac.uk'.
