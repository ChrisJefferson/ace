                        The ACE share package

The ACE share package provides an  interface  to  the  Advanced  Coset
Enumerator (ACE) from within GAP 4:

ACE coset enumerator (C) 1995-1999 by George Havas and Colin Ramsay
    http://www.it.uq.edu.au/~havas/ace3.tar.gz

The GAP interface has  been  written  by  Alexander  Hulpke  and  Greg
Gamble.

The package interfaces to an external binary  and  therefore  is  only
usable under UNIX or a UNIX-like environment.  It  will  not  work  on
Windows or the Macintosh. It requires at least GAP 4.2.


                   Installing the ACE share package

To install unpack the  archive  file  in  a  directory  in  the  `pkg'
hierarchy of your version of GAP 4. (This might be the `pkg' directory
of the GAP 4 home directory; it is however also possible  to  keep  an
additional `pkg' directory in you  private  directories,  see  section
"ref:Installing Share Packages" of the  GAP  4  reference  manual  for
details on how to do this.) Go to the newly  created  `ace'  directory
and call `configure <path>' where <path> is the path to the  GAP  home
directory. So for example if you install the package in the main `pkg'
directory call

  ./configure ../..

This will fetch the architecture type for which GAP has been  compiled
last and create a `Makefile'. Now simply call

  make

to compile the binary and to install it in the appropriate place.

Note that the current version of the configuration process  only  sets
up directory paths. If you need  a  different  compiler  or  different
compiler options, you need to edit `src/Makefile.in' prior to  calling
`make' yourself.

If you use this installation of GAP on  different  hardware  platforms
you will have to compile the binary for each platform separately. This
is done by  calling  `configure'  and  `make'  for  the  package  anew
immediately  after   compiling   GAP   itself   for   the   respective
architecture. If your version of GAP is already compiled (and has last
been compiled on the same architecture) you do not need to compile GAP
again, it is sufficient to call the `configure' script in the GAP home
directory.

For details on how to use the `ACE'  package  see  the  share  package
documentation in the `doc' subdirectory (execute `make_doc'  and  then
view either `manual.dvi' via `xdvi' or `manual.ps'  via  `ghostview'),
which gives information on how to use `ACE' from within GAP,  and  the
`ACE' user manual (`ace3001.dvi' created by executing `latex  ace3001'
three  times)  in  the   `standalone-doc'   directory,   which   gives
information on how to use the `ACE' binary as a stand-alone.

The `src' subdirectory contains a  copy  of  the  original  source  of
`ACE'. (The only modification  is  that  a  make-file  was  copied  to
`Makefile'.) You can replace it by a newer version before compiling.

The only known problems with  compilation  of  `ACE'  occur  with  old
versions of gcc (gcc 2.7.2.1 and gcc 2.7.2.3 under Linux are known  to
produce  a   buggy   `ACE'   whereby   options   that   output   coset
representatives may cause  a  segmentation  fault).  The  following  C
compilers are known to be ok:

   compiler             platform              comments
   --------             --------              --------
   gcc 2.8.1            Solaris 2.51/IRIX 6.5 
   cc MIPSpro 7.3.1.1m  IRIX 6.5              (compiled with -64 = 64bit)
   gcc 2.91.66 19990314 Linux                 (egcs 1.1.2 release)
   gcc 2.95.2 19990906  Linux                 (prerelease)
   gcc 2.95.2 19991024  Solaris 2.51          (release)

(Since April 1999, egcs has been the official Gnu cc supplier. This is
why the numbering now follows egcs' numbering.)
