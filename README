                        The ACE share package

The ACE share package provides functions associated with  Todd-Coxeter
coset enumeration by interfacing with the  Advanced  Coset  Enumerator
(ACE), 

ACE coset enumerator (C) 1995-1999 by George Havas and Colin Ramsay
    http://www.csee.uq.edu.au/~havas/ace3.tar.gz

from within GAP 4.

The GAP interface (share package) has been written by Alexander Hulpke
and Greg Gamble. In order to install the ACE share  package  you  must
get the archive file `ace.zoo' (which includes the C  source  code  of
Havas and Ramsay).

The ACE share package provides a  mechanism  to  replace  GAP's  usual
Todd-Coxeter coset enumerator by ACE, so that  functions  that  behind
the scenes use coset enumeration will use the ACE enumerator. The  ACE
enumerator may also be used  explicitly;  both  non-interactively  and
interactively. However the package is used, a plethora of options  and
strategies are available to assist the  user  in  avoiding  incomplete
coset  enumerations.  The  interactive  functions  provided  use   the
IOStream functionality first introduced in GAP 4.2.  (Hence,  the  ACE
share package requires at least GAP 4.2.)

You can download `ace.zoo' from the same places as GAP. The  main  FTP
servers are:

ftp://ftp-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/pub/gap/gap4/share/
ftp://ftp.math.rwth-aachen.de/pub/gap4/share/
ftp://ftp.ccs.neu.edu/pub/mirrors/ftp-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/pub/gap/gap4/share/
ftp://pell.anu.edu.au/pub/algebra/gap4/share/

`ace.zoo' is also available via the GAP www page at

or, alternatively, from one of the authors' home page at

http://www.csee.uq.edu.au/~gregg/ACE/home.html

Since the ACE share package interfaces to an external  binary,  it  is
only usable under UNIX or a UNIX-like environment. It will not work on
Windows or the Macintosh.


                   Installing the ACE share package

To install the ACE share package, move the  file  `ace.zoo'  into  the
`pkg' directory in which you plan to install ACE. Usually,  this  will
be the directory `pkg' in the hierarchy of  your  version  of  GAP  4.
(However, it is also possible to keep an additional `pkg' directory in
your private directories, see section "ref:Installing Share  Packages"
of the GAP 4 reference manual for details on how to do this.)

Then unzoo `ace.zoo' by

  unzoo -x ace

Go to the newly created `ace' directory and  call  `configure  <path>'
where <path> is the path to the GAP home directory. So for example  if
you install the package in the main `pkg' directory call

  ./configure ../..

This will fetch the architecture type for which GAP has been  compiled
last and create a `Makefile'. Now simply call

  make

to compile the binary and to install it in the appropriate place.

Note that the current version of the configuration process  only  sets
up directory paths. If you need  a  different  compiler  or  different
compiler options, you need to edit `src/Makefile.in' prior to  calling
`make' yourself.

If you use this installation of GAP on  different  hardware  platforms
you will have to compile the binary for each platform separately. This
is done by  calling  `configure'  and  `make'  for  the  package  anew
immediately  after   compiling   GAP   itself   for   the   respective
architecture. If your version of GAP is already compiled (and has last
been compiled on the same architecture) you do not need to compile GAP
again, it is sufficient to call the `configure' script in the GAP home
directory.

That's it. Now start GAP and type

  RequirePackage("ace");

The ACE banner should appear on the screen.

For details on how to use the ACE share package see the share  package
documentation in the `doc' subdirectory (execute `make_doc'  and  then
view either `manual.dvi' via `xdvi' or `manual.ps'  via  `ghostview'),
which gives information on how to use ACE from within GAP, and the ACE
user manual (`ace3001.dvi' created by executing `latex ace3001'  three
times) in the `standalone-doc' directory, which gives  information  on
how to use the ACE binary as a stand-alone.

The `src' subdirectory contains a copy of the C source code  for  ACE.
(The only modification is that a make-file was copied  to  `Makefile'.
You can replace it by a newer version before compiling.)

The only known  problems  with  compilation  of  ACE  occur  with  old
versions of gcc (gcc 2.7.2.1 and gcc 2.7.2.3 under Linux are known  to
produce a buggy ACE whereby options that output coset  representatives
may cause a segmentation fault). The following C compilers  are  known
to be ok:

   compiler             platform              comments
   --------             --------              --------
   gcc 2.8.1            Solaris 2.51/IRIX 6.5 
   cc MIPSpro 7.3.1.1m  IRIX 6.5              (compiled with -64 = 64bit)
   gcc 2.91.66 19990314 Linux                 (egcs 1.1.2 release)
   gcc 2.95.2 19990906  Linux                 (prerelease)
   gcc 2.95.2 19991024  Solaris 2.51          (release)

(Since April 1999, egcs has been the official Gnu cc supplier. This is
why the numbering now follows egcs' numbering.)
